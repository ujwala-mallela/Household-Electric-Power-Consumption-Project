# Literature
1. Electricity Consumption Dataset of Uruguay (ECD-UY):
Introduces ECD-UY, a dataset focusing on electricity consumption patterns in residential households in Montevideo. It includes subsets covering total household consumption, electric water heater usage, and disaggregated electricity consumption by appliance. Collected using smart meters, smart switches, and clamp meters, it contributes to understanding customer behavior and improving energy service quality. The collaboration between UTE and the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica highlights Uruguay's unique position with high renewable energy use. [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01122-x)

2. Residential Community Energy Consumption and Generation:
Presents a novel dataset focused on energy consumption and generation in a residential community, consisting of 50 households and a public building. The dataset includes consumption and photovoltaic generation profiles, providing valuable insights for advanced energy management models, demand response, machine learning algorithms, and smart building solutions.
